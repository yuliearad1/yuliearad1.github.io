title: Week 2

This week, we had five group meetings, two crash courses, two whole lab meetings and one for the CS Summer Research program through UIUC. During the crash courses, we learned about the different algorithms, PRM and RRT, and their different variations. In the first lab meeting, we each gave our updates on our individual projects and in the second lab meeting we discussed a potential project to hear about the next week The CS Summer Research program gave us food while we listened to a presentation about how to conduct research. 

This week, I first went through the code and decided which method should be where. I then proceeded to actually move everything to its proper position. I then made sure the code compiled and moved onto integrating the two files. This part is definitely trickier than expected, and I have not completed it yet. I also worked on my website this week.

This concludes my second week!

Next week, I will work on integrating the files and then move onto adding methods and hopefully get to testing.
