title: Week 4

This week, I once again presented my update on slides for the entire cohort. I heard feedback from others and was able to incorporate that into my work. 

My goals this week were to test the tool and integrate the tool and the strategy. The tool worked as it was supposed to in the test, so it seemed that we were in the clear to integrate. It took some time, as there were a lot of problems to debug, but I think that next week I will be able to complete the entire integration. 

This concludes my fourth week!
