title: Week 7
---

This week, I thought I would be working on experimenting but we had some ideas to implement that would make the code better, so I made those updates instead. Firstly, I added two variables that could separately control the number of samples per free and obstacle annuli. I added an obstacle ball re-expansion method as before there was only one for free balls and I added an obstacle ball re-expansion that would re-expand the k largest balls. 

This concludes my seventh week!
