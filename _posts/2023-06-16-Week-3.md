title: Week 3
---
This week, I finished updating this website, and added myself to the Parasol Lab website. This website helped me work on my writing skills, as I had to be concise when describing myself and my project. As well, in two of the meetings we had this week, I created slides to present the updates on my project to the team, which helped me consolidate my thoughts into one place. 

My goals this week were originally to integrate the tool and the strategy. However, after discussing the project with Stav, we decided to first go into the tool and change some things. The most drastic change that we made was changing most of the data structures from vectors to maps. I thought this would be a fairly easy task but it ended up being a challenge because it impacted other data structures that had to be rethought as well. I also added a method to delete balls. After completing these tasks, I worked on removing everything from the strategy so we could just test the tool, to ensure that it works as its supposed to. 

This concludes my third week!

Next week, I hope to test the tool, and then proceed to integrate the tool and strategy.
