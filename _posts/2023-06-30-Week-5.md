title: Week 5

This week, as per usual, we had two meetings to share updates about our project. I added a method to check whether a point is in a sphere, and in that case, which sphere. The strategy also compiles once integrated, however, I am now debugging the method that re-expands the ball. 

Next week, I hope to have a strategy that works and can be used for experiments. 

This concludes my fifth week!
